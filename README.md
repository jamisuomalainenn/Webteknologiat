ðŸ“‚ Project Progress

The repository is organized into two main sets of exercises: Tommiâ€™s exercises and Liisaâ€™s exercises.

Tommiâ€™s Exercises

Tasks: HTML task, Form task, CSS task 1, CSS task 2

Progress & Reflection:
During this part, my interest grew significantlyâ€”I finally got to do something where my own work was visible. Everything was new, and understanding didnâ€™t come immediately. CSS task 2, which involved working with the grid, was particularly challenging, so it may be slightly incomplete.
âœ… Overall, I am satisfied with my work considering my experience level.

Liisaâ€™s Exercises

Tasks: Introduction to JavaScript, Map task, Calculator task, Dynamic Media Element task, Grid task (list and grid), Ajax task

Progress & Reflection:
Interest continued to grow during this part. I had been looking forward to learning JavaScript since the beginning of the course. The tasks were challenging but achievable. The Media Element task posed difficulties with the Start/Stop button, but it was eventually made to work. Completing each task brought a strong sense of accomplishment.
âœ… I am very satisfied with the results.

Submission Notes

For Tommiâ€™s exercises, links to the task folders are provided, including CSS files, images, and HTML files.

Liisaâ€™s exercises were completed in the same folders, so Java, CSS, and HTML links were included in each Moodle submission box.

If a link does not work, navigating between folders on GitHub is straightforward because the folders are logically named.
